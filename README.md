# Calculator Web App

A simple, interactive calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations in a user-friendly interface. **Note**: This app is currently not responsive and is optimized for desktop view only.

## Features

- **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**: Supports basic arithmetic operations.
- **Interactive UI**: Buttons and display area styled for ease of use.
- **Clear Display**: A "C" button to clear the calculator display.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive button effects enhance the user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the calculator layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the calculator, including button aesthetics and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For handling calculator functionality and operations.

## Limitations

- **Non-Responsive Design**: This app is currently optimized for desktop view only and may not display correctly on mobile devices.
- **Simple Calculations**: The app only performs basic arithmetic operations. The most complex supported operation is the use of parentheses.
- **Parentheses Sensitivity**: The app does not automatically interpret implied multiplication. For example, `7 * (2 + 1)` will work, but `7(2 + 1)` will not.

## Easter Eggs

Here are some fun hidden features you can try out in the calculator:

- **Entering a calculation that usually results in an `error`**: Displays "prolly like 2" on the calculator screen.
- **Entering a calculation that usually results in a `domain error`**: Displays "Infinity" on the calculator screen.
- **Entering `8008` and pressing `=`**: Displays "Josh Peck" on the calculator screen.
- **Entering `80085` and pressing `=`**: Displays "( * ) ( * )" on the calculator screen.
- **Entering `8008135` and pressing `=`**: Displays "( * ) ( * )" on the calculator screen.
- **Entering `361/)/4/26` and pressing `=`**: Displays "Edward :)" on the calculator screen.

## Future Improvements

- **Responsive Design**: Adapt the layout for mobile and tablet screens to make the app accessible across all devices.
- **Additional Features**: Implement more advanced functions like square root, percentage, and memory storage options.
